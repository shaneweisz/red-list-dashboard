 * This is the only question the migration ever really had to answer, and for a
 * while it was answered in three places with three different rules: in the
 * matching phase (authorship, with an epithet fallback), in the lumped-counts
 * phase (re-derived from match_type and name_source), and again in build-parquet
 * (re-derived in SQL, with its own authorship and record-count tie-breaks).
 *
 * They disagreed, and every disagreement was a species showing the wrong number.
 * A frog listed EN displayed a congener's records because the SQL re-answered a
 * question the matching phase had already answered, using a different rule. So
 * the rules live in one module now, as pure functions, and everything downstream
 * reads the verdict instead of recomputing it.
 *
 * The whole thing reduces to one predicate — sameOrganism — plus one Red List
 * fact: whether the other name is itself separately assessed.

 *
 *   2. The same epithet under a different genus — a genus transfer, which is a
 *      rename and nothing more. Hylatomus pileatus -> Dryocopus pileatus,
 *      Drepanis coccinea -> Vestiaria coccinea.
 *
 *   3. The same author, and an epithet within a couple of letters — a respelling
 *      or a gender agreement. Pica nutalli -> nuttallii, Sminthopsis fuliginosa
 *      -> fuliginosus, both (Audubon, 1837) / (Gould, 1852) respectively.
 *
 * Neither signal is sufficient alone, and both failures cost real data:
 *
 *   - Authorship alone said yes to Pseudophilautus abundus -> P. procax. Two
 *     frogs described in the same paper share an author string verbatim, so
 *     authorship cannot distinguish a rename from a pair of congeners. An EN
 *     species displayed the other's records.
 *   - Epithet alone said no to Sminthopsis fuliginosa -> fuliginosus, which is
 *     one animal. Twenty-one species lost their own records that way.
 *
 * So epithet identity is proof on its own; authorship is only proof once the
 * epithet is already nearly identical. Acacia koaia -> Acacia koa is two edits
 * and would pass rule 3 on distance alone — different authors (Hillebr. vs
 * A.Gray) is what refuses it, which is the case that started all of this.
