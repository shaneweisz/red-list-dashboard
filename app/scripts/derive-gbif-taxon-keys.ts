/**
 * derive-gbif-taxon-keys: Red List group definitions → GBIF taxon keys
 *
 * Each Table 1a group is defined by the IUCN class or order names in TAXA[].redlist.
 * The GBIF side of the same group used to be a hand-maintained list of GBIF keys,
 * and hand-maintained lists drift from the definition they are supposed to mirror:
 *
 *   - Corals are defined as Scleractinia + Alcyonacea + Pennatulacea, but the GBIF
 *     side was a single class key (Anthozoa). That held while GBIF's Backbone put
 *     octocorals inside Anthozoa; Catalogue of Life raises them to a class of their
 *     own, so two of the three orders silently stopped being fetched.
 *   - Gymnosperms listed both Pinopsida and Gnetidae, and Gnetidae sits *inside*
 *     Pinopsida in CoL — so those species were counted twice, which is how 43
 *     species ended up with more records since assessment than in total.
 *
 * So the keys are derived from the group definition instead, and checked:
 *
 *   1. COVERAGE  — every class/order the Red List assigns to a group resolves to a
 *                  key. An unresolved name is a group silently missing species.
 *   2. NO OVERLAP — no key in a group is an ancestor of another in the same group.
 *                  Overlapping keys double-count in the year-bucketed count phase.
 *
 * Keys come from GBIF, never from a local copy of the checklist: GBIF's occurrence
 * index contains usages the published CoL export does not (see
 * docs/gbif-col-migration.md), so only GBIF can say what its own keys are.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/derive-gbif-taxon-keys.ts            # report only
 *   npx tsx scripts/derive-gbif-taxon-keys.ts --write    # also write the config
