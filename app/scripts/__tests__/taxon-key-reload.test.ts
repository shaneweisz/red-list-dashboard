/**
 * Phase 4b rewrites the root keys; phase 5 must then use the rewritten ones.
 *
 * This is the wiring that makes the sync survive a Catalogue of Life release.
 * When CoL renumbers a group root — Rhodophyta moved between COL26.6 and 26.7,
 * and Rhodophyta is red_algae's ONLY root — phase 4b derives the new key and
 * writes it, and phase 5 validates the keys it holds against the freshly built
 * taxonomy.
 *
 * The keys used to be a static `import` of the JSON, so they were fixed when the
 * process started, which was before phase 4b rewrote the file. Phase 5 therefore
 * checked the OLD release's keys against the NEW taxonomy, found them dead, and
 * failed the very run that had just repaired them. On the weekly Action that
 * fails the job before the commit step, so the corrected config is thrown away
 * with the runner and the next run does the same thing — red every Sunday until
 * someone ran the derivation by hand.
 *
 * The existing root-key tests all pass taxon literals straight to the guard, so
 * they verify the guard and not the wiring. This one goes through getTaxa(),
 * which is what the pipeline actually calls.
