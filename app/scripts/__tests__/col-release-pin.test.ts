/**
 * The pin that decides whether Phases 2-4 re-run.
 *
 * It used to record only the XR release, which follows GBIF's occurrence index.
 * The CURATED checklist moves on its own schedule — `3LR` was COL26.6 in June and
 * COL26.8 by late August while the XR pin had not moved at all — and
 * build-backbone stamps in_checklist / checklist_parent_id / checklist_name from
 * it. Those carry claims the UI renders beside links to that release's pages, so
 * a checklist-only roll that doesn't trigger a rebuild leaves a rename showing
 * the old accepted name next to a page that now disagrees.
 *
 * These cover the reading side, which is what the gate consults. Writing goes
 * through writeReleaseMetadata, so both are exercised together.
