/**
 * fetch-col-xr (#271, Phase 3): download the Catalogue of Life eXtended Release (XR)
 * ColDP archive and extract NameUsage.tsv + Reference.tsv + VernacularName.tsv — the
 * inputs to build-backbone.
 *
 * Downloads to a TEMP dir (outside data/) so the ~2.8GB TSVs are never swept into the
 * R2 upload; build-backbone reads them, then the sync removes the temp dir. Each XR
 * release gets its own numeric ChecklistBank dataset key (COL25.11 XR = 313100,
 * COL26.6 XR = 315557, …) and there's no rolling "latest" alias for XR the way
 * "3LR" rolls for the regular release.
 *
 * This deliberately does not want the latest. GBIF promotes each release to its
 * occurrence index 17-26 days after CoL publishes it, and the occurrence keys we
 * store are that release's ids, so resolveXrDataset() below pins to the release
 * GBIF reports it is running: COL_XR_DATASET override, then GBIF's index, then
 * whatever is already pinned on disk, and only as a last resort the newest —
 * which is a guess, and the specific guess known to be one release too far ahead.
 * (A hardcoded key is the opposite failure and also real: #276 had a sync
 * re-fetching a 7-month-old snapshot. The pin is re-checked every run, so it
 * tracks GBIF rather than standing still.) Shells out to curl + unzip (streams a
 * 1.4GB zip to disk — too big for an in-memory fetch).
 *
 * Reference.tsv (the cited-publication table) carries each reference's `col:issued`
 * date; build-backbone joins it via a name's `col:nameReferenceID` to recover the
 * described year for botanical/fungal names, whose author citations omit the year
 * (the zoological author-year columns cover the animal side).
 *
 * VernacularName.tsv (taxonID → common name, ~2M rows across all ranks) powers
 * order/family/genus-level common names in the dynamic taxonomic drilldown
 * (dynamic-taxon.ts) — species already get a common name from our own Red
 * List/GBIF data, so build-backbone only extracts the higher-rank subset.
 *
 * Returns the paths to the extracted TSVs (and their shared temp dir).
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/fetch-col-xr.ts        # downloads + prints the TSV paths

 * The Catalogue of Life release GBIF's occurrence index is built on.
 *
 * NOT the newest release, which is what this used to fetch. GBIF promotes each
 * CoL release to production roughly three weeks after CoL publishes it, so the
 * newest release is normally one ahead of the one GBIF is actually serving. Since
 * CoL renumbers usage ids for names whose authorship changes — around 2% per
 * release — being one ahead means a slice of GBIF's occurrence keys resolve to
 * nothing locally. Measured on this data: 504 assessed and 9,092 unassessed keys
 * unresolvable against the newest release, and zero against the indexed one.
 *
 * GBIF publishes which release it runs, though not where you would first look:
 * the dataset record's top-level `doi` tracks the newest crawl and is misleading,
 * while `/v2/species/match/metadata` reports the live index directly.
