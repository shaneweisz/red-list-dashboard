/**
 * build-search-index: the two name-sorted indexes the search bar reads — one over
 * species names, one over higher-rank taxon names — so a typeahead prefix query prunes
 * to a row group or two instead of scanning both species parquets end to end.
 *
 * assessed.parquet and unassessed.parquet are written ORDER BY class_name, order_name,
 * family (they're browse-ordered, which is what the species LISTS want), so a name
 * predicate can't prune a single row group: names are scattered across all of them. The
 * search hot path therefore read ~25MB off R2 per keystroke — ~2.2s per uncached query
 * in production, and the reason species-duckdb materializes search_idx in memory at all.
 *
 * This is the same trick synonym-index.parquet already uses (sorted by name, prefix-range
 * query, ~1 row group read) applied to the fast path. Sorted by name_lo, so:
 *
 *   WHERE name_lo >= 'panth' AND name_lo < 'panth' || chr(1114111)
 *
 * touches one row group. ROW_GROUP_SIZE is tuned for that read rather than left at the
 * default: 20k rows puts ~0.97MB in a group (103 of them), so a prefix query pulls about
 * a megabyte where the old path pulled ~25MB — and unlike the in-memory index it needs no
 * warm container to be fast. Measured locally: 9-13ms per query.
 *
 * One row per SEARCHABLE NAME, not per species — a species contributes its scientific
 * name, its common name, and its epithet, so "panthera", "lion" and "leo" all reach
 * Panthera leo by prefix. name_kind carries which, because the dropdown's ranking is
 * defined in those terms (exact common name > common-name prefix > scientific prefix).
 *
 * Rows carry the whole SearchResult payload, including the col_id the NE list keys on —
 * so a hit needs no join back to the species parquets and no species_link lookup, which
 * on the old path was another R2 read per search.
 *
 * Covers the fast path only (assessed ∪ GBIF-observed). The CoL-only and synonym tiers
 * are reached solely when nothing here matches, and they already have their own answer:
 * synonym-index.parquet is name-sorted, and species-duckdb primes both at warm-up.
 *
 * The second output, rank-index.parquet, is the same idea for the "Browse Felidae →"
 * suggestions: the DISTINCT class/order/family/genus names, pre-aggregated to ONE ROW
 * PER NAME and sorted, so suggestTaxa is a pruned range read rather than eight DISTINCT
 * scans of both parquets. Pre-aggregating here rather than at query time is also what
 * makes the answer deterministic — see the comment on the struct min below.
 *
 * Input: data/assessed.parquet, data/unassessed.parquet, data/species_link.parquet.
 * Output: data/name-index.parquet, data/rank-index.parquet.

 *
 *  1. suggestTaxa becomes a prefix-range read of a ~2MB file instead of eight DISTINCT
 *     scans of both species parquets — so, like name-index.parquet, it's fast on a cold
 *     container with nothing materialized.
 *
 *  2. It fixes a real nondeterminism. A name can occur in several taxon groups (the
 *     genus "×" is in mosses AND flowering plants), and the old query resolved that with
 *     arg_min(taxon_group, rp), whose tie-break among equal rp is arbitrary — parallel
 *     aggregation order, so it genuinely varied BETWEEN RUNS on identical data: two
 *     identical searches could offer to browse the same name in different taxa. Taking
 *     min() of a STRUCT instead compares field by field, in declaration order — coarsest
 *     rank, then alphabetically first taxon group — so the winner is total and stable.
 *     The lineage columns ride along in the same struct, which keeps them consistent
 *     with the group that won (and saves resolveTaxonSuggestionNode its own lookup).
