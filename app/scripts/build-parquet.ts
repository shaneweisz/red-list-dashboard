/**
 * build-parquet (#261): build the DuckDB read substrate from the per-group
 * Red List + GBIF CSVs + history. Three lineage-sorted parquets (split by the
 * assessed-vs-unassessed scale/schema asymmetry — assessed is bounded ~172k,
 * unassessed balloons under CoL):
 *
 *  - assessed.parquet     = Red List assessed species, enriched with GBIF
 *      occurrence counts summed across ALL their mapping links (canonical-
 *      preferred representative key). Rich schema; columns match SpeciesRow.
 *      Includes denormalized latest_assessors/latest_reviewers/latest_facilitators (history seq 0)
 *      and assessment_count (count of history rows) so the species list needs
 *      no history join (full history is lazy).
 *  - unassessed.parquet   = GBIF species not linked to any assessment (minus
 *      domesticated), category 'NE'. Lean schema — taxonomy + occurrence count
 *      only (no assessment-only columns, no obs-after-assessment-year).
 *  - assessments.parquet  = flattened assessment history (one row per past
 *      assessment, seq-ordered) for the species detail panel.
 *
 * The canonical species read substrate: powers the species list, lazy history,
 * and cross-taxa search. Sorted by lineage so
 * DuckDB row-group min/max prunes any taxonomic filter.

  // SQL version handed five species another accepted species' records, among them
  // Pseudophilautus abundus (EN), which showed P. procax's 21 instead of its own
