/**
 * fetch-wcvp-native-range: build a per-species native-country lookup from Kew's
 * World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP), for the "POWO" native-range source
 * option in OccurrenceMapRow.tsx (issue #82) — alongside the existing Red List
 * assessment-location-based source (`s.countries`).
 *
 * Source data: https://sftp.kew.org/pub/data-repositories/WCVP/wcvp.zip (CC-BY,
 * Govaerts et al. 2021, Sci Data 8:215) — `wcvp_names.csv` (taxon name -> accepted
 * name resolution) and `wcvp_distribution.csv` (accepted name -> native/introduced/
 * extinct TDWG WGSRPD level-3 area codes). Both pipe-delimited, no real quoting
 * (some author-name fields contain literal apostrophes, so `quote=''` is required
 * or DuckDB misparses them as unterminated quotes).
 *
 * TDWG level-3 area codes (e.g. "FRA", "COS") are matched to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
 * country codes via the original Brummitt Ed.2 WGSRPD table
 * (tdwg/wgsrpd, 109-488-1-ED/2nd Edition/tblLevel3.txt, `*`-delimited, Latin-1
 * encoded) — chosen over rWCVP's own `wgsrpd_mapping` crosswalk (Gallagher et al.
 * 2020) because that one only exists as an R `.rda` binary with no plain-text
 * source in the package repo. 41 of 369 L3 codes (11%) have no ISO code in the
 * official table — a mix of genuine multi-country composites (Baltic States,
 * Transcaucasus, ...) and a handful of single-country gaps that look like data-entry
 * omissions (Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Ukraine, ...), confirmed by
 * cross-checking that OTHER L3 codes for the same country (e.g. Russia's four other
 * L3 subdivisions) do have an ISO code filled in. WGSRPD_OVERRIDES below patches
 * the confident cases (single country, or an unambiguous small multi-country set)
 * and leaves the rest unmapped — matching this codebase's existing "don't flag what
 * we can't determine" convention (see isOutsideReportedCountry/isOutsideNativeRange).
 *
 * Covers the FULL WCVP checklist, not just species already in our own Red List
 * database — every species-rank name (Accepted or Synonym; ~1.05M rows) gets an
 * entry keyed by that exact name string, resolved to its accepted taxon's native
 * range via accepted_plant_name_id. Deliberately NOT scoped to our own assessed
 * species: this dashboard also shows a GBIF occurrence map for Not-Evaluated (NE)
 * species browsed from the Catalogue-of-Life-backed universe, which aren't in
 * assessed.parquet at all — scoping to our own species list would silently give
 * those zero POWO coverage even though WCVP has the data. A species (assessed or
 * NE) with no match (different spelling, taxonomic disagreement, or genuinely
 * absent from WCVP) simply gets no POWO option — the UI falls back to the Red
 * List source where available.
 *
 * Output is a Parquet file (not JSON) queried directly by DuckDB in
 * /api/wcvp-native-range at request time — a plain JSON import would force
 * parsing the entire ~49MB file into a JS object on every cold start just to
 * answer a single-name lookup (measured ~3s, and that parse blocks Node's
 * single-threaded event loop for its whole duration). Parquet lets DuckDB read
 * only the rows it needs.
 *
 * Also carries `powo_id` — the matched name's ACCEPTED taxon's own id (not the
 * matched name's own, which may be a synonym with a different id) — used to
 * link out to the taxon's real POWO page for reference/verification:
 * https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:{powo_id}
 *
 * Usage (re-run occasionally; WCVP ships periodic updates):
 *   npx tsx scripts/fetch-wcvp-native-range.ts [path-to-already-downloaded-wcvp.zip]
