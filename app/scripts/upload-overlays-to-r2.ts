/**
 * upload-overlays-to-r2: app/data/overlays/ → the maps R2 bucket
 *
 * The two context layers on the occurrence map are large, static and openly
 * licensed: RESOLVE Ecoregions 2017 and El-Gabbas's GBIF sampling-effort
 * raster. Neither belongs in git — together they are ~3 MB of binary that would
 * sit in the object history forever — and neither should be fetched from its
 * origin at runtime, which would put a dependency (and load) on somebody else's
 * service for a file that never changes.
 *
 * So they are built once by build-ecoregions-layer.ts and
 * build-sampling-effort-layer.ts, uploaded here, and served through
 * /api/overlays/<name>.
 *
 * Unlike the data sync, this writes to a fixed prefix rather than a timestamped
 * one. These are releases of external datasets, not a snapshot of ours: the
 * ecoregions have not changed since 2017 and the sampling-effort raster is a
 * published product. A new version means a new filename, which is a code
 * change and reviewable as one.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *   - R2_ACCOUNT_ID, R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID, R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, R2_MAPS_BUCKET_NAME
 *   - app/data/overlays/ populated by the two build scripts
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/build-ecoregions-layer.ts
 *   npx tsx scripts/build-sampling-effort-layer.ts --out data/overlays/sampling-effort-n_obs-10km.png
 *   npx tsx scripts/upload-overlays-to-r2.ts
