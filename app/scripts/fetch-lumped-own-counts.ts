/**
 * fetch-lumped-own-counts: occurrence counts for species Catalogue of Life lumps
 *
 * Some assessed species are, in CoL's view, synonyms of a different species. The
 * dashboard deliberately does not show them the other species' counts — that is
 * how a Critically Endangered Algerian willowherb came to display 295,698 records
 * of a common European one.
 *
 * But refusing the other species' records is not the same as having none. GBIF
 * holds the records identified under the species' own name against its own usage,
 * and those are legitimately its own:
 *
 *   Malus sieversii (VU)      146,340 shown -> 8,135 its own
 *   Epilobium numidicum (CR)  295,698 shown ->     0 its own
 *   Thymallus aeliani (EN)     73,641 shown ->    11 its own
 *
 * So blanking them outright trades a wrong number for no number when the right
 * number exists. This phase fetches it.
 *
 * The same problem has a second shape. Where CoL ranks a species below species —
 * Fringilla polatzeki (EN) is a subspecies of F. teydea in CoL — the key is the
 * species' outright, no lump involved, and the enumeration still cannot produce
 * it. Those were written off as "no GBIF data", which reads as "GBIF holds
 * nothing" when the truth is "a facet cannot express this key". 358 species lost
 * counts they had before this migration that way, 96 of them threatened.
 *
 * So the phase is really "count the keys the enumeration cannot emit", and it
 * takes both verdicts that mean the key belongs to the species: lumped and own.
 * (Its name predates the second case; the rename is tracked in the file-layout
 * restructure, since it moves the output file too.)
 *
 * These keys cannot come from the facet enumeration in fetch-gbif-species, which
 * only ever emits accepted, species-rank usages — a synonym's own key, or a
 * subspecies key, is absent from it by construction. So each is counted
 * directly, into a standalone
 * data/lumped-own-counts.csv rewritten whole on every run. It is deliberately NOT
 * appended into the per-taxon GBIF CSVs: that made the phase depend on its own
 * run history, so tightening the rule deciding which species qualify had no
 * effect on species a looser rule had already written.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/fetch-lumped-own-counts.ts

 *
 * LUMPED — the resolution to another species was refused, so the key kept is the
 * species' own usage, which is a synonym and therefore absent from a facet over
 * accepted usages. Only taken when the match came from the species' OWN name: a
 * match reached through one of its Red List synonyms landed on a usage that CoL
 * assigns to a different species, and the records under that name are not safely
 * this species'. Catapodium borgesii (VU, Azores endemic) is the case — matched
 * via a synonym onto Catapodium marinum, a widespread European grass, and 19,901
 * records is not a number to hand an island endemic on that basis.
 *
 * NOT_IN_FACETS — the resolution was followed and the key is real, but it is not
 * species rank, so no speciesKey facet contains it. Fringilla polatzeki (EN) is
 * one: CoL ranks it a subspecies of Fringilla teydea, the demotion is correctly
 * followed, and then the key finds nothing to join to.
