  // disable third-party user consent — Cambridge's tenant answers "Approval
  // required", and iucn.org is on Entra ID too (its DNS carries the
  // enterpriseregistration.windows.net CNAME), so the population this button
  // was added for is the population most likely to hit the wall. The requested
  // permissions are already the floor (User.Read + offline_access), so there is
  // no app-side fix; it's tenant consent policy.
  //
  // The sharper reason for hiding rather than leaving it: range-map access is a
  // hand-inserted user_roles row keyed to one user_id, and Supabase only links
  // identities when the verified email matches. Microsoft is the button most
  // likely to return someone's *work* address when their existing account is a
  // personal Google/GitHub one — silently forking a second, role-less account
  // for a user who already had access.
  //
  // Bring it back when either is true: an IUCN user confirms their tenant
  // permits consent, or the app becomes a verified publisher (which needs an
  // institutional sponsor — Microsoft's business verification wants a legally
  // registered entity, and the app registration must belong to a tenant tied to
  // that organisation's Partner Global Account).
  //
  // Azure only returns an email claim if the email scope is asked for
  // explicitly, and the rest of the app leans on email throughout — it labels
  // the account menu, it's the fallback avatar initial, and it's how an
  // account is looked up to grant the admin role in user_roles. A Microsoft
  // user without one would sign in to a half-broken session.
