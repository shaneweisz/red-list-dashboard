/**
 * Overrides layered on top of a node's own SpeciesFilter when computing its
 * Catalogue-of-Life-derived "described species" count (colDescribed) — used by
 * scripts/build-taxa-summary.ts (which needs the raw name lists to build SQL) and by
 * the frontend (which needs human-readable notes to explain a number that would
 * otherwise look unexplained, e.g. "why does Bison SG show a number at all when its
 * filter is genus: bison and Catalogue of Life has no genus Bison?").
 *
 * Kept in one place so the two stay in sync — a name added here for the SQL exclusion
 * automatically shows up in the tooltip note too, instead of two lists silently drifting.

// Domestic/feral forms that would otherwise inflate a CoL-derived "described species"
// count for the SSC group whose genus/family they fall under — e.g. Canid SG (family
// Canidae) would count the domestic dog as one of its described species. Each name here
// has a wild-form sibling species confirmed present separately in the CoL backbone
// (verified directly against data/species/), so excluding the domestic form doesn't
// lose real wild-species coverage:
//   Bos taurus (domestic cattle) — sibling: Bos primigenius (aurochs)
//   Bos frontalis (gayal/mithun, domesticated from gaur) — sibling: Bos gaurus
//   Bubalus bubalis (domestic water buffalo) — sibling: Bubalus arnee (wild water buffalo)
//   Canis familiaris (domestic dog) — sibling: Canis lupus
//   Equus caballus (domestic horse) — sibling: Equus ferus
//   Equus asinus (domestic donkey) — sibling: Equus africanus
//   Felis catus (domestic cat) — sibling: Felis lybica
//   Lama glama (domestic llama) — sibling: Lama guanicoe (guanaco)
//   Sus domesticus (domestic pig) — sibling: Sus scrofa (wild boar)
//   Vicugna pacos (domestic alpaca) — sibling: Vicugna vicugna (wild vicuña)
// Bubalus bubalis, Lama glama, and Sus domesticus were added to this list once the
// 2026-06-19 CoL XR release (COL26.6 XR) split each from its wild sibling as its own
// accepted species — a prior release lumped them together (or, for Lama glama, was
// missing the guanaco entirely), so excluding them wasn't possible/safe before then.
// If a future release re-lumps a pair (or splits another one, e.g. Bos frontalis),
// re-verify against data/species/ rather than assuming this list stays accurate.
