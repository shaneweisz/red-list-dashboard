/**
 * The country lookup tables used to exist twice — once in WorldMap.tsx for the
 * choropleth and once here for server-side callers (/browse, filter-vocab) —
 * and they drifted: the map learned about Curaçao, Hong Kong, Aruba and ~40
 * other territories, and learned that the 50m shapes spell it "Macedonia", while
 * the server-side copy kept the older, thinner list. So `?country=Curaçao`
 * resolved on the map and nowhere else. There is one copy now; these tests pin
 * the properties that made the drift invisible.
