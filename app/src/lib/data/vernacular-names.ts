/**
 * Loads data/vernacular-names.json (built by scripts/build-backbone.ts from the
 * CoL XR export's VernacularName.tsv — see that script's file comment) into
 * dynamic-taxon.ts's EXTRA_VERNACULAR_NAMES, once per warm server process.
 *
 * Server-only (fs) — deliberately kept out of dynamic-taxon.ts itself, which is
 * bundled into the browser too (TaxaSummary.tsx imports it directly). Call
 * ensureVernacularNamesLoaded() before any server-side dynamicNodeDisplayName()
 * call that should reflect CoL-derived names (getLiveRankChildren,
 * getLiveBreakdown, filter-vocab.ts's taxonLabel) — idempotent, so calling it
 * on every request is cheap after the first.
