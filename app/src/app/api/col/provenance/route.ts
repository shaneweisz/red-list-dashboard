/**
 * Where a Catalogue of Life record came from — the provenance block CoL shows
 * on a taxon page ("Taxonomic scrutiny", "Source", "Original record"), for the
 * ⚑ tooltip on the dashboard — minus the parts that grade or date the record
 * rather than trace it (see `scrutinizer` and the note below).
 *
 * Provenance only — who CoL credits, which dataset it came from, where to check
 * it. CoL also rates each source (a 1-5 `confidence` and a `completeness`
 * percentage) and neither is shown. Both grade the DATASET, but printed beside
 * one record they read as a verdict on that record, and this tooltip exists
 * because the record may be wrong.
 *
 * Dasycercus is the case that settled it. CoL recognises two species,
 * cristicauda and blythi, sourced from ITIS — which CoL rates 5/5. Newman-Martin
 * et al. (2023, Alcheringa) revised the genus to six, confirming hillieri as
 * valid and describing three more; the Mammal Diversity Database and IUCN both
 * follow that, and IUCN assesses all six. So CoL is three years behind here, and
 * "Confidence: 5/5" on that record would have been our own UI contradicting the
 * flag beside it.
 *
 * Deliberately provenance only: who CoL credits, which dataset it came from, and
 * where to check it. CoL also rates each source (a 1-5 `confidence`, and a
 * `completeness` percentage), and neither is shown. Both grade the DATASET, but
 * beside a single record they read as a verdict on that record — and this
 * tooltip exists precisely because the record may be wrong. Telling someone a
 * record is 5/5 trustworthy in the same breath as "CoL may not have caught up
 * here" is a contradiction, and the score is the half that is not ours to make.
 *
 * None of this is in our own backbone: build-backbone reads NameUsage.tsv, which
 * carries names and ranks, not sectors. It takes three ChecklistBank calls to
 * assemble — taxon → sector → source dataset — which is why it lives behind one
 * route rather than being fetched from the browser.
 *
 * Cached twice over: an edge cache on the response, and process-lifetime maps
 * here. CoL only changes this on a release, and the sector→source hop is shared
 * by every species from the same source, so a family's worth of hovers costs one
 * extra call rather than one each.
