          This dashboard is part of a PhD research project at the University of
          Cambridge, which is the data controller. We collect a small amount of{" "}
          <strong>anonymous usage analytics</strong> to understand how the
          dashboard is used and to improve it, and — only if you choose to sign
          in — the account details described below.

          the dashboard shows by default is public, and you do not need an
          account to use it. If you do sign in with Google, Microsoft or GitHub,
          we store the email address, name and profile picture that provider
          gives us, so the site can show who you are signed in as and, for a
          small number of accounts, unlock additional map layers. We never
