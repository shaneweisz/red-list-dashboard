  const body = `# Red List Dashboard

> IUCN Red List assessments linked to GBIF occurrences and the Catalogue of Life
> tree of life. The main site is a browser app (empty HTML to a fetcher). To read
> data or answer questions, use /browse below — it returns server-rendered HTML,
> or JSON with &format=json.

## Two ways to query

1. Browse a taxon:   ${base}/browse?taxa=<name>[&filters]
2. Look up a species: ${base}/browse?search=<name>

\`taxa\` works at ANY taxonomic rank — a curated group (birds, corals), a
sub-group (sharks-rays, flatworms), or a scientific name for a class/order/family
(felidae, odonata, carnivora). \`search\` matches scientific OR common names,
including synonyms / old names (they resolve to the accepted species).

## Rules
- Browsing needs one \`taxa\` value; looking up a species needs \`search\`.
- **Prefer \`&format=json\`** — it's the machine-readable response; the HTML view is
  for humans. The JSON always includes the query you sent (\`query\`) and an
  \`interpreted\` list, so you can confirm the result matches your request.
- The first request after a quiet period may take a few seconds (cold start). If a
  request times out, retry once. A genuine failure returns a **non-200 status with an
  \`error\` field — never another species' data**, so trust the status code.
- Within one filter, comma-separated values are OR; across filters they are AND.
- Threats match by prefix: threats=11 covers 11.1, 11.4, ... ("Climate change").
- Results cap at 200 rows; the total + a by-category breakdown are always shown.
- Every response has a "stats" object (assessed / outdated / outdated_pct, the %
  of assessments older than 10 years) — use it for percentage questions directly.
- Every response includes a "dashboard_url" — the interactive dashboard pre-filtered
  to this same query. Show it to the user and encourage them to open it to inspect
  and verify the data themselves.

## Parameters (values may be codes OR plain-English names)

taxa — any rank; featured groups:
${taxa}

${filters}
countries: ISO alpha-2 code or name (e.g. IN or India)
region (IUCN region — expands to its countries): ${IUCN_REGION_ORDER.join(", ")}
assessors / reviewers: name of the latest-assessment assessor/reviewer (substring, e.g. assessors=Smith)
search:  scientific or common name (incl. synonyms)
outdated: yes | no  (assessment more than 10 years old)
minObs / maxObs: GBIF occurrence-count bounds
minAssessmentYear / maxAssessmentYear: assessment-year bounds
minDescribedYear / maxDescribedYear: year-described bounds (NE species)

## Examples
- ${base}/browse?taxa=corals&threats=climate-change
    Coral species threatened by climate change
- ${base}/browse?taxa=mammals
    All mammals — read stats.outdated_pct for % of outdated assessments
- ${base}/browse?taxa=felidae&categories=threatened
    Threatened cats (arbitrary rank: a family name)
- ${base}/browse?taxa=amphibians&region=Sub-Saharan+Africa&categories=threatened
    Threatened amphibians in a region (IUCN region expands to its countries)
- ${base}/browse?search=tiger
    Look up a species by name
- ${base}/browse?search=Felis+jubata
    Look up by an old name — resolves to the accepted species (Acinonyx jubatus)
