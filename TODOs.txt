GBIF page shouldnt default to plant page, start with summary page.
Rename tabs to Red List and GBIF, with Red List tab on the left, GBIF on the right.
Rename the headings to GBIF Explorer and Red List Explorer
Change from estimated described species to a more verified described species number with a link to the source (see what we previously had for plants with a link to the source page)
Don't apply a default sort to the red list table.
Ensure the GBIF counts on the red list page are accurate
